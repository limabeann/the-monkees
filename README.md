# The Monkees

This project is based on the 1960s rock band 'The Monkees'. The project is for my first milestone project. Covering User Centric Frontend Development.

## UX

The client required a website that showcased what the rock band was all about. The target audience was for fans and potenital fans. They required it to showcase images of the band and a video. Alongside this the band wanted to present its music to the user so they could check out the bands music style. A key feature they requested was the ability for fans to contact them for potenital events. This needed to be as responsive as possible.

The designs for this were made in the form of wireframes using photoshop software. Please find the images and .psd file included in this project.

## Features

Audio player - allows users to listen to the music of The Monkees.
Video player - allows users to watch a video of The Monkees.
Contact form - allows users to contact The Monkees to potentially hire them for an event.

### Features left to implement

It would be good for future versions of the website to include a more expansive library of images, videos and music with a handy search feature for the user.

## Technologies Used
